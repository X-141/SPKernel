This directory is not directly attached to the kernel project.
However, this directory contains basic library functions with test cases.

Any needed changes to library functions in the kernel should first make the changes
here in the testing directory

List of Header Libraries:
1) string.h
    int uint_to_string(char* str, unsigned int value, int size);
        -> Converts given value to ascii string and stores it into str.
        -> size parameter will limit how much of the converted value can
        -> be stored in str.
        -] Return 0 when value can't entirly fit into str.
        -] Return 1 on success.
    int strncmp(const char* s1, const char* s2, int size);
        -> Compare string s1 and s2.
        -] Return 0 if s1 and s2 are equal.
        -] Return positive value if character in s1 is greater than s2.
        -] Return negative value if character in s1 is less than s2.
